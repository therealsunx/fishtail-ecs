# Fishtail - ECS

Fishtail - ECS is an Entity Component System library written in C/C++. It is suitable for making games and stuff. It prevents you from the pitfalls of OOP and inheritance while creating different objects for your games.

Learn more about ECS in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system).

## Usage & Development

If you want to use it (after it is complete, of course), then simply clone this repo inside your C++ project and you're ready to roll. Simply include the `fishtail-ecs.h` header file and roll on.

If want to continue developing it from its current state, then simply clone the repo, create a `main.cpp` file for testing it and include `include/fishtail-ecs.h` file in it and go on using the ECS-registry. Everything that you need should be inside the `fishtail-ecs.h` header file.

__Don't forget to compile the source code with `src/fishtail-ecs.cpp` file included.__
